# Savill Production Analysis
This project analyzes vendor performance and material defects at Savill Production Company to optimize the supply chain.

## Project Overview
The analysis focuses on:
- Vendor performance in terms of defect quantities, downtime, and cost impact.
- Material defects affecting production, with emphasis on batteries and mechanical categories.
- Trends in defect quantities over 2018-2019.

## Key Files
- `FINAL_SAVILL_ANALYSIS.doc`: The report outlining the analysis and recommendations.
- `/data`: Raw and cleaned datasets used for the analysis.
- `/scripts`: Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- `/images`: Graphs and charts visualizing vendor and defect trends.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend strengthening quality assurance protocols, closely monitoring suppliers, and investigating Q4 trends to mitigate the rise in defects.

### How to Run the Code
Ensure you have Python installed, and the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

Run the analysis scripts using:
```bash
python analysis_script.py
